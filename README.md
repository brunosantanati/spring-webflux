Dear All,

Developing a scalable, robust and resilient reactive systems can not be taught in one single course. I would encourage you to enroll the courses in the below order for better understanding of the reactive programming, reactive microservices, improve the app performance, make them scalable and to think like an architect!!

[Part-1: Java Reactive Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-java-reactive-programming/?referralCode=0B0EC90B024080E656F4):   This course explains the Reactive Programming fundamentals! What it is, how to think, design & structure the code using Reactive programming. 11+ hour course which explains what you need to know to be good at reactive programming.


[Part-2: Reactive Microservices with Spring WebFlux](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-webflux/?referralCode=E5376C4D4303C02AD3AB): Once we are comfortable with Reactive Programming, It is time for us to utilize our skills to develop Reactive Microservices using Spring WebFlux. We will learn how to create a complete reactive stack all the way up to Databases. We will also see how to use SSE to push real time notifications to the browsers.


[Part-3: Spring RSocket](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-rsocket/?referralCode=A72EC8A45FE10100B46E): Once we have developed Reactive Microservices, our job is not yet done! What about the Inter-Microservices communication? How to make use of the full potential of reactive programming to make the Microservices communication more efficient? RSocket (reactive-socket) is a modern protocol which gives 10X performance improvement in Microservices communication.


[Part-4: Redis with Spring WebFlux](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-webflux-redis/?referralCode=DE8B9FBDA7097BF08E6A): This course talks about creating Scalable Microservices with the help of Redis. We talk about creating real-time trends, chat application using WebSockets, GeoSpatial application development with Redis etc


[Part-5: Design Patterns With WebFlux](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-webflux-patterns/?referralCode=42E47B81CC8B4926BD28): This course introduces various integration and resilient design patterns for creating more robust and resilient reactive systems.


[Part-6: GraphQL with Spring WebFlux](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-spring/?couponCode=NOV_2023_1) - Learn GraphQL - Modern API query language to tailor API requests depending on the client needs & fetch multiple data with a single API call.


[Part-7: Reactive Kafka From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-kafka-reactive/?couponCode=NOV_2023_1) - Learn Kafka from scratch to get started with developing Event Driven Microservices.
